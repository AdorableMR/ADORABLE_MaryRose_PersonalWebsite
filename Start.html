			In this personal website, I will be showing some information about me such as my hobbies, personal information, educational backgrounds, my achievements and some things I always wanted to do. 
			This is my very first website and I admit that I am not that really good as of now, but I's still hoping someday that as an IT student, 
			and as I go through with my journey in this field, I will be able to improve myself and show to the world 
			one of my greatest achievement in life. In making this website, at first I was really struggling since I don't have any background
			with all of the things involved in making websites such as HTML and CSS. Lucky enough that we had a crash course on some other subjects
			with all of those topics that served as one of my foundation. Additionally, I have friends with me and classmates as well that were willing
			enough to help me overcome this project. During my struggles in making this website, I found myself hopeless that I might not able
			to accomplish this task. Lots of my colleagues and professors recommended the 'www.w3school.com' site which really contributed a lot of resources which
			made this personal website a successful one. As I explore in making this, I was able to learn more. After all, there's always room for improvement.
			Just never give up and dream high! Thank you for reading this and God bless us all!
