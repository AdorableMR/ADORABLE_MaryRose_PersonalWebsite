<br><b>MY PAST WORK EXPERIENCE</b></br>
<br><b>POSITION:</b><i> Market Research Interviewer<i></br>
<br><b>COMPANY:</b> Survey Sampling International(SSI, Philippines)</br>
<br>
	Working in SSI is such a very wonderful opportunity I had ever encounter in my 18 years of existence.
	I encountered lots of people with different personalities and treatments towards me. Working there is really
	unforgettable and memories are really worth-keeping. Last June 2017, was the summer break for us USePians since
	we adopted the calendar shift where classes starts every month of August.
	That time I planned to apply to a job where I am able to enhance my personal skills, expose myself
	to the real world of work and most especially I just thought that I want to make my summer break a productive one,
	so as to have savings for the upcoming enrollment and other personal needs. After all, my goal in helping 
	my parents to sustain our daily needs is one of my main reason why I worked there. I tried to apply to some
	other BPO companies to apply as a customer service representative but unfortunately, I wasn't able to get
	the job knowing the fact that they don't hire students according to rumors because of commitment issues.
	Despite of this, I didn't considered it as a hindrance nor an obstacle to achieve my goal that time
	and by God's grace I was hired by the Survey Sampling International Company as a Market Research Interviewer.
	Moreover, the work is just very easy but the real challenge is to wake up very early in the morning like 2:00 am for us 
	not to be late in our shift. One of my goal that I achieved as I work there was my communication skills.
	When we were inside the building, we are expected to speak in english only and avoid vernacular language. Yes,
	it is quite difficult, but if you were really willing to learn then you'll accept the challenge. 
	When I was working there, it is also hard to speak English straightly, but still, I am doing my best
	to enhance my abilities especially when dealing with other people since I admit that I'm a shy type person. 
	Moreover, this last August 15,2017, I had a conflict with my class schedule and the shift, so I decided to 
	have an immediate resignation of course for academic purposes.
	After all, I conclude that working is not very easy the way we expected it. I realized a lot of things, and one of which is that
	being a parent to a number of children is not very easy nor to earn a living. So we must appreciate and acknowledge
	the things our parents did and sacrificed for us  or like me as a daughter to survive in life.
