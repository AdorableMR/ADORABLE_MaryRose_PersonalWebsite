<div class="Myself" style="color:white">
<p>
	My name is Mary Rose C. Adorable studying at University of Southeastern Philippines
	taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am currently living at Shrine Hills, Matina, Davao City.
	My hobbies are watching movies and cheerleading. Cheerleading had a very big impact in my entire college life until now.
	When I was in first year college, my friends told me to join as well, and so we did
	but what happened was, all of my friends who invited me left the team due to some personal reasons and it turned out
	that I was the one who stayed long to the team. With that, my journey in life become more fruitful. We joined open competitions 
	in Panabo, Intramurals Cheerdance Competitions in USEP, and once invited to perform in one of the biggest and known event here in Davao City 
	which is the One Love One Nation Duterte celebration with my squad, and after all built better relationships with each other like a family. We gained new friends from different places,
	and most especially gained unforgettable moments that are really worth-keeping.
	Through this, I also experienced lots of ups and downs but what's more important is that I had learned a lot of things.
	I fell literally many times, but it doesn't mean I should give up. I learned more to fight and gain more courage
	to face every trials life may bring.
</p>
<p>
	I am a shy type person but I am still able to easily deal
	with other people. Time passes I found myself already that I developed and enhanced my self-confidence when facing a lot of people.
	I have many goals in life that I wanted to achive to help my parents and so as to give them a better living.
	I admit sometimes that sometimes laziness and hopelessness strikes me and I sometimes forget that I still have goals
	to fulfill, but thanks to the people around me who always reminds me my true purpose in life.
